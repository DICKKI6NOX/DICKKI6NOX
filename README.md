- 👋 Hi, I’m @DICKKI6NOX
- 👀 I’m interested in using small computers like Raspberry pi.  I have RPI's from the first version onward to the RPI pico.
I started programming on UNIVAC 1 in the 1960's.  I wrote major programs for the Bureau of the Census for the 60 Census.  
I was briefly on the COBOL development team. I have written a COBOL program on the RPI to test it out -- it worked!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, having priviously programmed the UNIVAC 1105 in assembly language, and APL, Fortran, Lua, 
Ruby, Pascal and other languages on other computers.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate with anyone as 86 YO and retired.
- 📫 How to reach me: Dickames@starstream.net
